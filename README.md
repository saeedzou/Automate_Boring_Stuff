# Automate Boring Stuff
This repository contains programs that automate everyday boring tasks.

## Setup
You should download the latest [selenium driver](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/getting_started/install_drivers/) for your browser. I used Microsoft Edge in my implementations, so you'll have to change the webdriver to your browser. The webdriver also needs to be added to PATH.
To run a program just run it as a python file.
## Contents
### Login automation
[This](https://github.com/saeedzou/Automate_Boring_Stuff/blob/master/login_automation_for_Sharif_university_loginpage.py) automates login-based networks that require credentials to be used.
Update the USERNAME and PASSWORD variables in the file to your credentials.
### Train Ticket Checker
[This](https://github.com/saeedzou/Automate_Boring_Stuff/blob/master/train_ticket_checker_on_Alibaba_website_IR.py) is a program I wrote to check for available train tickets in a price range. 
It is not scalable and you're gonna have to do some updates to the url paths if you need it to work.
I will implement a notifier in a future version
